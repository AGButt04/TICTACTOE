🧠 AI Challenge
Try to beat the AI! The minimax algorithm ensures the computer plays perfectly:

Best case for human: Tie game (if you play perfectly)
Realistic outcome: AI wins (if you make any mistake)
AI never loses: Mathematically guaranteed optimal play

The AI evaluates every possible future game state to choose the move that guarantees the best outcome. Can you achieve a tie against perfect play?
